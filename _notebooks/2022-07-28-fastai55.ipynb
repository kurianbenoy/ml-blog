    "My perspective: I have seen this cliche argument that for learning ML, you need to go into details and not using frameworks is a step down. Jeremy emphasises always use good frameworks on top of it. Rather than re-inventing from scratch. Lot of the success of fast.ai comes from it not asking practitioners to go into details, I feel. One of the reasons I like frameworks like blurr, Icevision is also because of that and it's helping users.\n",
