    "\n",
    "Most of the time as a practitioner, your job is to connect a set of inputs to the sets of outputs you want with machine learning algorithm together in a framework. According to Jeremy what is important is how you tweak on first layer and last layer of neural network. The middle layer is usually not that important.\n",

    "## Why you should use a framework?\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook, does some interesting feature engineering followed by building models with fastai framework. It also shows how to use ensembling with fastai library and to get in the top 25% of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have seen this cliche argument that for learning ML, you need to go into details and using frameworks is a step down. Jeremy emphasises always use good frameworks on top of it. Rather than re-inventing from scratch. Lot of the success of fast.ai comes from it not asking practitioners to go into details. One of the reasons I like frameworks like blurr, Icevision is also because of that and it's helping users who are familiar with fastai to easily build complex computer vision and NLP models.\n",
    "\n",
    "During a conversation with Icevision core-developer, [Dickson Neoh](https://dicksonneoh.com/):\n",
    "\n",
    "> In icevision, within 10 minutes I can train an object detection model with any dataset. It may not be most accurate, yet I can iterate so quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How random forests really work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Jeremy was know as the random forest guy before he became know as the Deep learning person. One of the cool things about random forest is it's very hard to get something wrong unlike logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are really intereptables, and helps in getting good accuracy. He also covered about gradient boosted trees during this lesson."
