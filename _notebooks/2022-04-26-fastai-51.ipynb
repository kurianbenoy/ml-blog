Students who have enrolled via University of Queensland(with almost 350 people attending in-person and about 100 people remotely as well).\n2. fastai fellows who have acknowledged for their contribution to community.\n\nJeremy recommends having study buddies when we are learning the course is important. So he asks to create Study groups wherever possible. This course is now happening after a gap of 2 years, so there is a lot of new things which has to be covered as Deep learning moves so fast. \n\n\nUsing Dalle-2 technique we can generative creative images from generate twitter bios. For a creative person, this can be very helpful to create good artwork.

In NLP it breaks lot of stuff\n\nWhat's really go in on : in arthur samuel with graph. The graphs are build with gv2 in jupyter\nnotebook. Deploying models in ML is a bit tricky.
