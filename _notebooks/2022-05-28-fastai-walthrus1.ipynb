    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jeremy](https://forums.fast.ai/u/jeremy) has been conducting these official course walk-thrus which started on May 27, 2022 for students of [fastaiv5 course](https://itee.uq.edu.au/event/2022/practical-deep-learning-coders-uq-fastai). The idea of these course walk-thrus were \"going to explain exactly how to do every step, and why we do things the way we do\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We in the sense `fastai` approach of development. It was very useful to me and it covered answers to some of things which I was searching for a long time. I will use it again and again, so thought of writing it down to refer later. The first walk thrus was on the topic: `Introduction to the terminal. How to install Python and libraries ` and I felt I got more value out of these walk-thrus than some of lessons in course\n",
    "\n",
    "> Important: The right way here means the way Jeremy does stuff. Obiviously there as thousand of way to do thing, yet going through each ways has it's own pros/cons. \n",

    "## 🚖 What's terminal, how to work with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminal vs Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "A terminal is a program which can display console window to run program. Yet thing inside is not strictly a terminal, but called a shell. \n",
    "The black coloured stuff, which you see in movies used by hackers is Terminal as shown in image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24592806/170852543-17bdb268-7ace-43c6-b1a0-a2b5b0a9ac43.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually in a **terminal there can be multiple shells**, which can have different colours, shells etc. So terminal and shell are totally different in meaning. You can think shell as the a ship which does main things it's supposed to do like running program, while terminal is like the a group of ships which is usually controlled by a parent like a corporal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a windows terminal it can start no of shells like `PowerShell, Command Prompt, Ubuntu` etc... Most of the time we use both terminal and shell interchangebly which is ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Terminal & Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install terminal in Windows by downloading [Windows terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=US). In case of linux/MacOS, you can just search for terminal as it will come with a terminal pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows, Jeremy recommends to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which install a linux distribution within windows and then install [Ubuntu from Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/ubuntu/9PDXGNCFSCZV).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handy Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to change the default shell from `Power shell to Ubuntu` for easy usage. Also learn some keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Important: Learning Keyboard shortcuts can be immensely valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyboard shortcuts\n",

    "\n",
    "To follow this advice, this let's go ahead and install python seperately with packaging manager called [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) which is a Fast Cross-Platform Package Manager. It's aka. faster version of conda.\n",

    "So go to the [mambaforge installer](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge). Based on your operating system, download the shell script to install with:\n",

    "\n",
    "> Note: If you are a beginner, working with virtual environments is intimidating. So jeremy recommends whenever you face any issues as a beginner, it's important to know how to delete your setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are steps to see if conda/mamba is properly uninstalled in a linux environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "(base) kurianbenoy@Lap-34:~/blog/ml-blog$ which jupyter\n",
    "/home/kurianbenoy/mambaforge/bin/jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Then remove mamabaforge folder. In linux usually, mambaforge is installed in /home/username.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to delete the mambaforge package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(base) kurianbenoy@Lap-34:~$ ls\n",
    "blog  downloads  mambaforge\n",
    "(base) kurianbenoy@Lap-34:~$ rm -rf mambaforge/\n",

    "kind of python versions are near their end of life and [can be here](https://endoflife.date/python). At the time of writing any version above python 3.7 to python3.10 is recommended to use. Yet according to Jeremy, he usually prefers to use latest python only 1 year after it's released, but fastai do support the latest version.\n",

    "[Radek](https://twitter.com/radekosmulski/) who is a engineer at Nvidia, told he usually prefer mamba because with just one line of code you can switch to any python version you want. Afer the session in forums, Radek shared how to do this as shown in below screenshot.\n",

    "One of fastai students, during the start of lesson talked about the need of a quick setup, which just works as expected. One of biggest takeaways for me, personally is a quick and fastsetup to do my experiments in DataScience. Sometimes installing packages in data science can take hours of effort, and that's why I really loved this setup. \n",
