    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jeremy](https://forums.fast.ai/u/jeremy) has been conducting these official course walk-thrus which started on May 27, 2022 for students of [astaiv5 course](https://itee.uq.edu.au/event/2022/practical-deep-learning-coders-uq-fastai). The idea of these course walk-thrus were \"going to explain exactly how to do every step, and why we do things the way we do\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We in the sense `fastai` approach of development. It was very useful to me and it covered answers to some of things which I was searching for a long time. I will use it again and again, so thought of writing it down to refer later. The first walk thrus was on the topic: `Introduction to the terminal. How to install Python and libraries ` and I felt I got more value out of these walk-thrus than some of lessons in course\n",
    "\n",
    "> Important: The right way here means the way Jeremy does stuff. Obiviously there as thousand of way to do thing, yet going through each ways has it's own pros/cons. \n",

    "## 🚖 What's terminal, how to work with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminal vs Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "A terminal is a program which can display console window to run program. Yet thing inside is not stricly a terminal, but called a shell. \n",
    "The black coloured stuff, which you see in movies used by hackers is Terminal as shown in image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24592806/170852543-17bdb268-7ace-43c6-b1a0-a2b5b0a9ac43.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually in a **terminal there can be multiple shells**, which can have different colours, shells etc. So terminal and shell are totally different in meaning. You can think shell as the a ship which does main things it's supposed to do like running program, while terminal is like the a group of ships which is usually controlled by a parent like a corporal. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a windows terminal it can start no of shells like `PowerShell, Command Prompt, Ubuntu` etc... Most of the time we use both terminal and shell interchangebly which is ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Terminal & Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install terminal in Windows by downloading [Windows terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=US). In case of linux/MacOS, you can just search for terminal as it will come with a terminal pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows, Jeremy recommends to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which install a linux distribution within windows and then install [Ubuntu from Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/ubuntu/9PDXGNCFSCZV).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Handy Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a good idea to change the default shell from `Power shell to Ubuntu` for easy usage. Also learn some keyboard shortcuts.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Important: Learning Keyboard shortcuts can be immensely valuable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyboard shortcuts\n",

    "\n",
    "To follow this advice, this let's go ahead and install python seperately with packaging manager called [mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) which is a Fast Cross-Platform Package Manager. It's aka. faster version of conda.\n",
    "\n",
    "So go to the [mambaforge installer](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge). Based on your operating system, download the shell script to install with:\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🐛 Uninstalling mamba/conda\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: If you are a beginner, working with virtual environments is intimidating. So jeremy recommends whenever you face any issues as a beginner, it's important to know how to delete your setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These are steps to see if conda/mamba is properly uninstalled in a linux environment:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check if ipython, jupyter is installed. If yes, first uninstall it. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: You can uninstall via:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip uninstall jupyter\n",
    "pip uninstall ipython3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**You can check the path of program by typing the command, to see if was installed by system python or mamba**\n",

    "(base) kurianbenoy@Lap-34:~/blog/ml-blog$ which jupyter\n",
    "/home/kurianbenoy/mambaforge/bin/jupyter\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Then remove mamabaforge folder. In linux usually, mambaforge is installed in /home/username.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to delete the mambaforge package:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "(base) kurianbenoy@Lap-34:~$ ls\n",
    "blog  downloads  mambaforge\n",
    "(base) kurianbenoy@Lap-34:~$ rm -rf mambaforge/\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "One of fastai students, during the start of lesson talked about the need of a quick setup, which just works as expected. One of biggest takeaways for me, personally is a quick and fastsetup to do my experiments in DataScience. Sometimes installing packages in data science can take hours of effort, and that's why I really loved this setup. \n",

    "Thanks to [Jeremy Howard](twitter.com/jeremyphoward/) for creating this quick setup and for starting the project [fastchan](https://www.fast.ai/2021/07/15/fastconda/)."
