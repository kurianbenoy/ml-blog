    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jeremy](https://forums.fast.ai/u/jeremy) has been conducting these official course walk-thrus which started on May 27, 2022 for students of fastaiv5 course. The idea of these course walk-thrus were \"going to explain exactly how to do every step, and why we do things the way we do\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We in the sense `fast.ai` approach of development.I personally felt some of these things were very useful to me  and I may use it again and again. So thought of writing it down. Personally I got more value out of these walk-thrus than some of lessons in course as I felt it covered answers to some of things which I was searching for a long time. So the first walk thrus was on the topic: `Introduction to the terminal. How to install Python and libraries `.\n",

    "## What's terminal, how to work with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Terminal vs Shell\n",
    "A terminal is a program which can display console window to run program. Yet thing inside is not stricly a terminal. \n",
    "The black coloured stuff, which you see in movies used by hackers is Terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24592806/170852543-17bdb268-7ace-43c6-b1a0-a2b5b0a9ac43.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually in a **terminal there can be multiple shells**, which can have different colours, shells etc. So terminal and shell are totally different in meaning. You can think shell as the stuff which does main things, while terminal is like the big parent ship. In a windows terminal it can start no of shells like `PowerShell, Command Prompt, Ubuntu` etc... Most of the time we use both terminal and shell interchangebly which is ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Terminal & Shell\n",
    "\n",
    "You can install terminal in Windows by downloading [Windows terminal](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-us&gl=US). In case of linux/MacOS, you can just search for terminal as it will come with a terminal pre-installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Windows, Jeremy recommends to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), which install a linux distribution within windows and then install [Ubuntu from Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/ubuntu/9PDXGNCFSCZV).\n",
