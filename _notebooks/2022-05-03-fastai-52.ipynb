    "\n",
    "Few things have changed in book in this version:\n",

    "- Github Desktop: Hamel who was a employee in github previously, is even using github desktop. Some complicated stuff in git can be solved using this tool. Even knowing terminal is cool.\n",
    "- WSL: As a datascientist, you spend a lot of time in terminals. Just use ubuntu with windows terminal. Any time Jeremy shows in terminal, he just uses windows terminal.\n",
    "- In terminal, he uses Tmux as a terminal emulator as pointed out in [fast.ai forums for my question](https://forums.fast.ai/t/lesson-2-official-topic/96033/231?u=kurianbenoy).\n",
    "\n",
