It's' a previlege\nat the same time, a dream come true moment for me, as a fastai student who took\nsome part of fast.ai from the year 2018.\n\nThe fastai course has seen a lot of success stories over the years. Amazing folks\nlike Aman Arora, Olive, Sanyam Bhutani,Radek Osmulski, Jason Antic, Wayde Gilliam, Zach Mueller ... While there are lot of people whom may not be so well know as well like [Bhuvana who\nshared her journey in Pycon India 2019](https://youtu.be/TGIEOSrEyD8). The way this course\nhas democratized AI & ML is simply amazing.\n\nToday [Radek Osmulski](https://twitter.com/radekosmulski) joined NVIDIA AI.\n\n> twitter: https://twitter.com/radekosmulski/status/1518786955278192640","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It was Radek who had posted in fastai forums few years back on [how he will approach taking the fastai course](https://forums.fast.ai/t/what-i-will-focus-on-to-succeed-in-this-course/6926). Inspired by that I am creating this action list items on things which I am planning to achieve during duration of this course.\n\nI will do following:\n\n1. Try out every notebook given by Jeremy during class and writes in Kaggle\n2. Dream and breath Pytorch\n3. Write blogpost every week with lesson summary and occasionally on new things I learning during course.\n4. Build some hugging face spaces using fastai\n5. Challenge myself to complete the existing project I am doing on IPL Commentary Summarizer.\n6. Attend the [delft-fast-ai-study-group sessions](https://www.meetup.com/delft-fast-ai-study-group/events/285269418/) atleast for five weeks.\n\nExtra Credits:\n\n1. Participate in NLP competition provided by jeremy link\n2. Frequent in fast.ai forums and discord group\n3. Take a look at notebooks in Transformer Book if you cover NLP extensively during class\n\nI won't do:\n\n1. Won't read Pytorch book(even though it's very tempting to do)\n2. Be active in twitter during course\n3. Read EDA notebooks\n4. Won't write any notebooks in tensorflow :)\n5. Won't participate in any other kaggle comps during course period.\n6. I will be not attending Real Python community meetups, unless I have a very compelling doubt.\n\nWith that I am winding for today.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
