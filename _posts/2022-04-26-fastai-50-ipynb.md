<p>Last week I enrolled for the live cohort of Deep Learning For Coders
with fastai coruse which is going to be taken by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/howardjeremy">Jeremy Howard</a>. It's' a previlege
at the same time, a dream come true moment for me, as a fastai student who took
some part of fast.ai from the year 2018.</p>
<p>The fastai course has seen a lot of success stories over the years. Amazing folks
like Aman Arora, Even Oldridge, Sanyam Bhutani,Radek Osmulski, Jason Antic, Wayde Gilliam, Zach Mueller ... While there are lot of hidden gems whom may not be so well know in community as well like <a href="https://youtu.be/TGIEOSrEyD8">Bhuvana who
shared her journey in Pycon India 2019</a>. The way this course
has democratized AI &amp; ML is simply amazing.</p>
<p>Today <a href="https://twitter.com/radekosmulski">Radek Osmulski</a> joined NVIDIA AI.

<p>It was Radek who had posted in fastai forums few years back on <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/what-i-will-focus-on-to-succeed-in-this-course/6926">how he will approach taking the fastai course</a>. Inspired by that I am creating this action list items on things which I am planning to achieve during duration of this course.</p>
<p><strong>I will do following:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Try out every notebook given by Jeremy during class and writes in Kaggle</li>
<li>Write blogpost every week with lesson summary and occasionally on new things I learning during course.</li>
<li>Build some hugging face spaces using fastai.</li>
<li>Challenge myself to complete the existing project I am doing on <a href="https://github.com/kurianbenoy/chaloRR">IPL Commentary Summarizer</a> and learn NLP extensively.</li>
<li>Attend the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/delft-fast-ai-study-group/events/285269418/">delft-fast-ai-study-group sessions</a> atleast for five weeks.</li>
<li>Go to sleep before midnight</li>
<li>Dream and breath pytorch</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Extra Credits:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Participate in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/us-patent-phrase-to-phrase-matching/overview">NLP competition provided by jeremy link</a>.</li>
<li>Frequent in fast.ai forums and discord group</li>
<li>Take a look at notebooks in Transformer Book to learn NLP extensively during class.</li>
<li>Try to read Pytorch book</li>
<li>Complete all the college assignments in Pytorch</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>I won't do:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Be active in twitter during course</li>
<li>Write or read EDA notebooks</li>
<li>Won't write any notebooks in tensorflow :)</li>
<li>Won't participate in any other kaggle comps during course period.</li>
<li>I will be not attending Real Python office hours, unless I have a very compelling doubt.</li>
</ol>
<p>With that I am winding for today.</p>
