<h2 id="Lesson-Notebooks">Lesson Notebooks<a class="anchor-link" href="#Lesson-Notebooks"> </a></h2><p>There are four notebook covering Paddy Disease Competition, and I feel each of these notebooks are excellent:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/first-steps-road-to-the-top-part-1">Road to Top Part 1</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/small-models-road-to-the-top-part-2">Road to Top Part 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/scaling-up-road-to-the-top-part-3">Road to Top Part 3</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/multi-target-road-to-the-top-part-4">Road to Top Part 4</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="How-was-Paddy-competiton-for-me?">How was Paddy competiton for me?<a class="anchor-link" href="#How-was-Paddy-competiton-for-me?"> </a></h2><p>This competition is still ongoing at the time of writing. Yet during one month break during which <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM">Jeremy's live-coding sessions</a> were held. I got some time to play with Paddy disease classification competition with this competition with other fastai friends also.</p>
<p>At the start of lesson 7, Jeremy said some kind words to Nick and me which can be found in below youtube video. I am extremely lucky to learn from such a great teacher. Without these four notebooks and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfYUBJiXbdtSLBPJ1GMx-sQWf6iNhb8mM">Jeremy's live-coding sessions</a>, it wouldn't have been possible.

I am not going in detail on this lesson, as I feel the introduction notebooks have covered everything so well. So signing off early this time.</p>
