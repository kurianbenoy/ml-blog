<h2 id="Lesson-Setup">Lesson Setup<a class="anchor-link" href="#Lesson-Setup"> </a></h2><p>Jeremy was taking this session from his home, as the venue in University of queensland was already
booked by someone else. Jeremy was really really pumped for this lesson and it's like going to the early days of fast.ai with lot of super exciting work happening.

<p>Jeremy mentioned some technique on using Jupyter notebooks, and asked to take a look at jupyter extensions. The navigation section and how to collapse headings was explained during class. [24:00]</p>
<h2 id="Fastbook-Chapter-2">Fastbook Chapter 2<a class="anchor-link" href="#Fastbook-Chapter-2"> </a></h2><p>This week we started by taking a look at putting model in production using fastai. This was the same
thing which is covered in chapter 2 of Deep Learning book To build grizzly bears and teddy bears classifier.</p>
<p>Few things have changed in book in this version:</p>
<ul>
<li>using <code>search_images_ddg</code> instead of bing search apis</li>
<li>using <code>huggingfaces spaces</code> as deployment instead of voila even though it's still works<blockquote><p>RandomResizedCrop could be a good idea to understand different varieties of same image.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Does RandomResizedCrop crop duplicate the image -- i.e. you get multiple copies and you ensure that all the parts of the image are used in training? or does it just make one crop?</p>
<p>Jeremy answered it in video at [32:30]. His answer was it doesn't copying image. In each epoch everyimage get's written and what happens is in-memory image is being wrapped by recropping and colouring in realtime during model training. It's like infinitely multi-copies of images.</p>
<p>Check the book to learn more in detail about various augmentations.</p>
<p>Sanyam mentioned that RandomResized crop as a augmentation is very helpful:

<p>I asked <a href="https://twitter.com/waydegilliam/">Wayde Gilliam</a> who is a long term fastai community member after the lesson about his process of watching lectures. He was gracious enough to share it with mith

<h2 id="Huggingface-spaces">Huggingface spaces<a class="anchor-link" href="#Huggingface-spaces"> </a></h2><p>Jeremy pointed to tanishq tutorial on <a href="https://tmabraham.github.io/blog/gradio_hf_spaces_tutorial">Gradio + HuggingFace Spaces</a>.</p>
<p>Also Jeremy mentioned some good tools which are useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>Github Desktop: Hamel who was a employee in github previously, is even using github desktop. Some complicated stuff in git can be solved using this tool. Even knowing terminal is cool.</li>
<li>WSL: As a datascientist, you spend a lot of time in terminals. Just use ubuntu with windows terminal. Any time Jeremy shows in terminal, he just uses windows terminal.</li>
<li>In terminal, he uses Tmux as a terminal emulator as pointed out in <a href="https://forums.fast.ai/t/lesson-2-official-topic/96033/231?u=kurianbenoy">fast.ai forums for my question</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Jeremy like Windows due to easiness in streaming, good apps and recording capabilities. Yet Jeremy also has a linux environment with a good Deep learning jig.
{% include note.html content='Jupyter notebooks debugging with magic methods %time, %debug' %}</p>
<p>In fastai for inference, it returns back a tensor. One of issue in gradio tensors is not supported at moment. So we need to convert tensors to float and do prediction.</p>
<p>Jeremy created a <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/jph00/pets">cats vs dogs classifier using spaces</a>. 
His daughter when realised he is building such a classifier googled something which is a mix of cat and dog. For that his initial prediction
was like 50-50% for both cats and dogs.</p>
<p>This kind of shows how important the support system around you and how much they acknowledge
the work you do. This personally touched me. As my sister was encouraging me
to go an all-nighter to complete the <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/kurianbenoy/audioclassification">Music genre classification spaces</a>.</p>
<p>TODO: Look through Jeremy setup and how he worked with gradio in local [58:00 onwards 1:14:00]</p>
